                hundredth) for whenever you spend and an asset to invest the
                roundups. When you spend from your bank account, the app gets

                spending of #400 with your debit confirmation and immediately
                Rounds it off to your preferred roundup setting, assuming the
                nearest hundredth, which is #500. It substracts the Roundup
                amount #500 from your actual spending for the airtime which is
                #400 = #100. Checks your bank balance to see if you have #100
                spare, if yes, you have, it deducts it and invests in your
